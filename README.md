# Next.js Missing Return Statement Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes elusive bug in Next.js applications: a missing `return` statement in a functional component.  This can lead to runtime errors that aren't always easy to track down.

## The Bug

The `pages/about.js` file contains a functional component that is missing a `return` statement.  This causes a runtime error when that page is visited.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code, adding the necessary `return` statement to the functional component.  This ensures that the component renders properly and prevents the runtime error.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about` in your browser.  You should see the error.
5. Refer to `bugSolution.js` to see how to fix it.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking for missing `return` statements in your Next.js components.
